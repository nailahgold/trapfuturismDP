		<p>[Verse 1]
		This ain't no motherfucking playground
		Bitch we don't play 'round
		I was wearing wigs
		Think I'm moving on to braids now
		Everything I do
		Bet she wanna do it too now
		Watching how I move
		Tryna study all the tools
		But you can't, you a lame
		I can tell your pussy stank
		Riding in that big body, when I hop out bet it dank
		I'm on E lil' bitch, but I got a full tank
		Fake on me lil' bitch, bet it make a bitch shake
		First time I hit a mill I went and got some Gucci
		Tell these bitches pull up and they playing hooky
		If you ain't got bottles or bands bitch, don't book me
		Run up on her, dark alley, in a black hoodie
		B-b-b-bitch this the sugar trap turn your shit to puddin'
		I'm always in the stu' bitch look at what I'm cookin'
		I'm always this in some new shit so these hoes lookin'
		And if you run up I bet you getting your shit tooken</p>

		<p>[Chorus]
		I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya (Remind ya)
		Don't hide, I can always come and find ya (Find ya)
		Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper (Bitch, come proper)
		In an Audi going fast, you behind us (You behind us)
		I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya (Remind ya)
		Don't hide, I can always come and find ya (Find ya)
		Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper (Bitch, come proper)
		In an Audi going fast, you behind us (You behind us)</p>

		<p>Kodak’s attorney Bradford Cohen also confirmed his client’s release, telling the Miami Herald, “He is out. His plans are to decompress for a period and take it all in. He is appreciative to the president and his team for giving him this chance.” 

<br>Though Kodak Black is out of prison right now, his freedom might not last much longer. That’s because he still has a pending case for criminal sexual misconduct in South Carolina, which he was indicted for in 2017. Due to Kodak’s long history of legal troubles and the length to which this particular case has been drawn out, a lot of information has been left out of the conversation and the whole thing is confusing to follow. So, here is a breakdown of what’s happening in Kodak Black’s ongoing criminal case. </br>

<br>Kodak Black is being accused of assaulting and raping a female victim in South Carolina. The alleged assault took place in February 2016, following Kodak’s performance at Treasure City club in Florence, South Carolina. The victim says she attended the concert at Treasure City, where she met Kodak Black, and later accompanied the rapper to his hotel room at a Comfort Inn and Suites. She told police that he began to tear her clothes off and said he “couldn’t help himself” as she screamed and tried to push him off her. According to police reports, she says he bit her repeatedly and raped her as she screamed for help. The victim, who was reportedly a high school student at the time, told her school nurse, who alerted the Florence County Sheriff’s Office.</br>

<br>When was Kodak Black indicted?</br>
<br>Although the alleged assault occurred in February 2016, Kodak was not indicted by a grand jury until October 2017. He was indicted for first-degree criminal sexual misconduct. Of the grand jury’s decision, Twelfth Circuit Solicitor Ed Clements told reporters, “We have to seek justice. Part of that is making sure that the defendant has their rights protected. And [we're going to] treat him just like we would anybody else. We [are going to] protect his rights. And give him a fair adjudication of his charges.”</br></p>

		<p>[Verse 2]
		Hey, every day is lovely, every day is sunny
		I don't need your money, bitch, I got my own money
		Should have seen the shit comin'
		Seen that bitch start punchin'
		Red Audi fruit punchin'
		If we fight you know my niggas gonna jump in
		I ain't scared, bitch
		Just a whole lotta gang shit
		I'm a bear, you a mother fucking reindeer
		Where I stay, you can't mother fucking stay there
		Yuh, and I had to make that shit clear bitch</p>

		<p>[Bridge]
		I said I'm in a red Audi, bitches fruit punchin'
		On a beat I don't punch in</p>

		<p>[Chorus]
		I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya (Remind ya)
		Don't hide, I can always come and find ya (Find ya)
		Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper (Bitch, come proper)
		In an Audi going fast, you behind us (You behind us)
